### Lets Decompose It

- Structure
  - what is the form of the interrelated elements
- Behavior
  - what is the functionality that the interrelated elements provide
- Execution
  - how the functionality provided by the interrelated elements is carried out
- Analysis
  - what are the nonfunctional properties that the interrelated elements satisfy

#### These concerns are embodied in

- Component as the software architectural concept of element
- Connector as the software architectural concept of relationship between elements

### Issues

This statement lead an issue on how to organize system so that can serve and ensure the quality of functional service
