# My Class Notes

Recently i started to realize the importance of notes taking. Therefore to boost up the start of my passion for taking notes, I tried to package them into a form that is more than just notes. even though a lot of the content written here is copy-paste from books, but that's the same thing lecturers did right?

Another reason is also because of my bad habit of skipping classes. It's a bad thing i know, but I do other productive things. I swear really. But that's not a good reason because that's the choice I made. Therefore I have to catch up by reviewing the material given by the lecturer. The way I do it is by making notes from it and tosses it here.

So here we are, a page that hopefully contains a lot of knowledge. Oh yeah, btw i published the page so I can access it from my phone.

Right now the page is generated using [MDwiki](http://mdwiki.info). Maybe later this can be developed even more with some advance frontend feature but i do love to keep the site static so maybe i would use something like [astro](https://astro.build/)

Because right now it use [MDwiki](http://mdwiki.info) the site is just something like SPA with markdown as datasource
