# Structured Heuristic Method

## Structured Era (1960 - 1980)

Software split into functions and data that tossed by the function.

Each method has its own blueprint/  diagram to describe it.

Some popular structured method:

- SADT (Structured Analysis & Design Technique)
- SA/SD (Structured Design)
- SSADM (System Analysis & Design Model)

## Pros

- Procedure detailed & step by step
- Lots of tools to choice
- Integrated Documentation
- Fully or partial automate

## Cons

Because multiple programs access the same data, the system becomes difficult to develop

## Systems Development Life Cycle

1. Project definition
2. Feasibility study
3. Detailed investigation and analysis
4. System design
5. Program design & coding
6. Implementation & review
7. Maintenance
