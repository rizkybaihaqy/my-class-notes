# Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM)

The idea is business consist of smaller area called subsystem (accounting, business, production). Systems analyst's job is to explore goals for each subsystem __to improve business efficiency__.

Checkpoints may be included at the end of one or more tasks to review the results to date and to ensure that the user and analyst are in agreement with such results .

SSADM utilize the involvement of users in the development of new systems through the use of reviews. __The user's primary concern is in how the system is going to be presented to them__.

## Problems

- User need to understand the technic and diagram used
- If the user didn't want to be involved
- Too much user involvement

## Key Principles

- Iterative Approach
- Top down approach
- Separation of logic
  - The structure of the data
  - The way in which the data is moved round the system
  - The way that data changes through time

## Stages of SSADM

Consist of 4 modules with 6 stages.

- Feasibility Study Module
  - Feasibility study
- Requirements Analysis Module
  - Investigation of Current environment
  - Business system option structure
- Requirements Specification Module
  - Requirement definition structure
- Logical System Specification Module
  - Technical System Options Structure
  - Logical design Structure
- Physical Design Module
   Design Physical System

### Stage 1

Focus on area where business operate. Gather detailed requirements and business model to reflect analysis result.

- Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
  - developed in Stages 1, 2 and 3 of SSADM during the analysis phase
- Logical Data Model (LDM)
  - Serve the entity an its relation as __Logical Data Structure__
- Requirements Catalogue (RC)
- User Catalogue (UC)

### Stage 2

Provides User Management with prepared options (Business System
Options) describing the scope and functionality of alternative ways of developing a system to meet their requirements.

### Stage 3

Definition of Requirements takes the selected Business System Option and refines the requirements catalogue, data and process models expanding the detail into function descriptions and Input/Output structures.

### Stage 4

Technical system option is the evaluation of the best technical products to meet the requirements specification. This is carried out in parallel with

### Stage 5

Logical Design, (i.e. what the new system will do) providing the
detailed specification of processing structures, data and Human
Computer Interfaces in the form of dialogues.

### Stage 6

Physical design (i.e. how the new system will work) specifies the
physical data, processes, inputs and outputs. In reality it covers everything needed to decide an application 's construction and implementation methods.

## A Critique

- Not involving Strategic planning and some aspects of design such as the human computer interface
- Complex and confusing for the person newly exposed to SSADM
- There are lots of hidden cost. eg. for training and maintenance
